## 🧠 What I Learned

Through this project, I explored Atlassian Forge in depth and learned:

- How to use the **Forge CLI** for app scaffolding, development, and deployment.
- The role of core files like `manifest.yml`, `package.json`, and Forge-specific resolvers.
- Creating responsive frontend interfaces using **ReactJS** and `@forge/react`.
- Implementing **resolver functions** to fetch and process data from external APIs.
- Working with **UI Kit components** for rapid UI development within the Atlassian design system.
- The advantages of **serverless development** for rapid iteration and secure deployment.
